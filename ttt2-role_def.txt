Visually and functionally, the defective operates similarly to a regular detective. They use the detective's shop, have a DNA scanner, and obtain credits in the same manner as a detective. However, they are a traitor: They take up a traitor's spot and a traitor test will reveal them as such.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
